# Churn

# Telecom Churn Analysis

This repository hosts a Jupyter notebook `Telecom_Churn_Notebook.ipynb` dedicated to the analysis of churn within a telecom dataset. The notebook explores various data preprocessing steps, identifies high-value customers, and investigates patterns that might indicate a likelihood of churn.

## Overview

The analysis includes:

- **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Initial steps to load the telecom dataset and clean it for analysis.
- **Missing Value Treatment**: Techniques to handle missing values in the dataset, filling them appropriately based on the analysis requirements.
- **High-Value Customer Identification**: Strategies to filter and retain high-value customers from the dataset for focused analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: An exploration phase to understand the characteristics of the data and the patterns related to churn.

## Getting Started
